Mysite is the repo for confessin.appspot.com

Basically tells about me and stuff. (Yeah I thought my code can't say enough :/)

Anyways It was an experiment as well with the new "responsive" style HTML5 code. You can resize it to any level and it will still look beautiful. Yeah go ahead :)

It can be accessed from any device, In the same way. The divs are fluidic and can move according to the display size.

Aint it awesome :) . Cant stop looking at it on my pre 3 :D
